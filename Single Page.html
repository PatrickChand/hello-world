        <h2>Abandoned and Chosen</h2>
        <p class="subhead">When <em>Paul Jobs</em> was mustered out of the Coast Guard after World War II, he made a
        wager with his crewmates. They had arrived in San Francisco, where their ship was
        decommissioned, and Paul bet that he would find himself a wife within two weeks. He was
            a taut, <strong>tattooed engine mechanic, six feet tall,</strong> with a passing resemblance to James Dean.
        But it wasn’t his looks that got him a date with Clara Hagopian, a sweet-humored daughter
        of Armenian immigrants. It was the fact that he and his friends had a car, unlike the group
        she had originally planned to go out with that evening. Ten days later, in March 1946, Paul
        got engaged to Clara and won his wager. It would turn out to be a happy marriage, one that
        lasted until death parted them more than forty years later.</p>

        <p>Paul Reinhold Jobs had been <cite>raised on a dairy farm in Germantown</cite>, Wisconsin. Even
        though his father was an alcoholic and sometimes abusive, Paul ended up with a gentle and
        calm disposition under his leathery exterior. <time datetime="2017-07-08T18:30:00">tonight at 6:30</time> After dropping out of high school, he
        wandered through the Midwest picking up work as a mechanic until, at age nineteen, he
        joined the Coast Guard, <abbr title="National Football league">MLB</abbr> (Major League Baseball) even though he didn’t know how to swim. He was deployed on the
        USS General M. C. Meigs and spent much of the war ferrying troops to Italy for General
        Patton. His talent as a machinist and fireman earned him commendations, but he
        occasionally found himself in minor trouble and never rose above the rank of seaman.</p>

        <h2>Silicon Valley</h2>
        <p>The childhood that Paul and Clara Jobs created for their new son was, in many ways, a
        stereotype of the late 1950s. <blockquote>When Steve was two they adopted a girl they named Patty, and
        three years later they moved to a tract house in the suburbs. The finance company where
        Paul worked as a repo man, CIT, had transferred him down to its Palo Alto office, but he
        could not afford to live there,</blockquote> so they landed in a subdivision in Mountain View, a less
        expensive town just to the south.</p>
        <p>There Paul tried to pass along his love of mechanics and cars. “Steve, this is your
        workbench now,” he said as he marked off a section of the table in their garage. Jobs
        remembered being impressed by his father’s focus on craftsmanship. “I thought my dad’s
        sense of design was pretty good,” he said, “because he knew how to build anything. If we
        needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I
        could work with him.”</p>

        <h2>Reed College</h2>
        <p>Seventeen years earlier, Jobs’s parents had made a pledge when they adopted him: He
        would go to college. So they had worked hard and saved dutifully for his college fund,
        which was modest but adequate by the time he graduated. But Jobs, becoming ever more
        willful, did not make it easy. At first he toyed with not going to college at all. “I think I
        might have headed to New York if I didn’t go to college,” he recalled, musing on how
        different his world—and perhaps all of ours—might have been if he had chosen that path.
        When his parents pushed him to go to college, he responded in a passive-aggressive way.
        He did not consider state schools, such as Berkeley, where Woz then was, despite the fact
        that they were more affordable. Nor did he look at Stanford, just up the road and likely to
        offer a scholarship. “The kids who went to Stanford, they already knew what they wanted
        to do,” he said. “They weren’t really artistic. I wanted something that was more artistic and
        interesting.”</p>
        <p>Instead he insisted on applying only to Reed College, a private liberal arts school in
        Portland, Oregon, that was one of the most expensive in the nation. He was visiting Woz at
        Berkeley when his father called to say an acceptance letter had arrived from Reed, and he
        tried to talk Steve out of going there. So did his mother. It was far more than they could
        afford, they said. But their son responded with an ultimatum: If he couldn’t go to Reed, he
        wouldn’t go anywhere. They relented, as usual.</p>
